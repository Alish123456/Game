## First Steps Guide

### Your First 10 Minutes

1. **Explore the Village** (starting location)
   - Type `m` to see available directions
   - Try going `west` to the Tavern first

2. **Check Your Inventory**
   - Type `i` to see what you have
   - You start with a sword, armor, and 2 potions

3. **Read Your Quest**
   - Type `q` to see your first quest
   - Follow the objectives to progress

4. **Go to the Forest**
   - From the village, type `m` then `north`
   - You'll likely encounter your first enemy!

5. **Fight Your First Battle**
   - Choose `a` to attack
   - Use `i` to drink a potion if health is low
   - Defeat the enemy to gain XP and gold

### Combat Tips for Beginners

**During Battle:**
- Attack when enemy health is high
- Use potions when YOUR health drops below 50%
- You can try to flee (`r`) but it's only 50% successful

**After Battle:**
- You automatically gain gold and XP
- Sometimes enemies drop better equipment
- Level up when you get 100 XP

### Survival Tips

1. **Save Often** - Type `save` regularly
2. **Buy Potions** - Rest costs 20 gold but fully heals
3. **Explore Everything** - Some areas have hidden items
4. **Don't Rush** - Level up before going to dangerous areas
5. **Read Descriptions** - They hint at what's ahead

1. Village → Tavern → Village
