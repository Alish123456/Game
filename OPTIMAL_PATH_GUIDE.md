```

**IF NO AI (rule-based):**
```

```

### PHASE 6: Guardroom Encounter (Actions 16-18)

**Turn 16:**
```

Description: You burst in! Guards shocked but reaching for weapons!
Choice: [This leads to combat or talk]

```

**Turn 17:**

## 💡 Pro Tips for Best Path

### Time Management:
- Flooded cell: FAST decisions (5 actions max)
- After escape: Can be methodical
- Listen > act rashly

### Combat Strategy:
- Always look for WEAKNESSES in descriptions
