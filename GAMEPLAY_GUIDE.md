# Zagreus' Descent - Gameplay Guide

## Overview
This is a complex, narrative-driven dungeon crawler with branching paths, AI-powered responses, and brutal difficulty.

## Core Mechanics

### Decision System
- Each situation presents 4-6+ choices
- Choices lead to different paths through the story tree
- Paths can branch, converge, or dead-end
- Some choices are only available with specific items/conditions

### AI Dungeon Master
When you select "Custom action", you can type anything you want to do.
The AI evaluates your action based on:

1. **Your Stats**
   - Strength: Physical power, melee damage
   - Agility: Dodge chance, hit rate, climbing
   - Mind: Resist mental effects, solve puzzles

2. **Your Equipment**
   - Weapon: Increases damage, unlocks attack options
   - Light source: Reveals hidden details, improves accuracy
   - Armor: Reduces damage taken
   - Accessories: Special effects

3. **Your Condition**
   - Health: Current/max HP
   - Stamina: Energy for actions
   - Hunger: Increases over time, leads to death at 100
   - Wetness: Affects temperature regulation
   - Temperature: Too hot or cold causes damage
   - Sanity: Low sanity causes hallucinations, bad choices

4. **Body Status**
   - Can lose limbs (arms, legs)
   - Can lose eyes (impairs vision)
   - Missing body parts affect available actions

### Combat System
Combat uses the AI Dungeon Master system:

**Example Combat Actions:**
- "Aim for its eyes" - High damage if eyes are weak point
- "Dodge and counter" - Requires agility
- "Attack its legs" - Can slow enemy
- "Use fire" - Effective against certain enemies
- "Block with weapon" - Requires weapon equipped

**Combat Factors:**
- Enemy type and weaknesses
- Your weapon (or lack thereof)
- Light level (darkness = penalties)
- Your wounds and missing limbs
- Environmental hazards

### Survival Elements

**Hunger**
- Increases every 5 turns
- At 100, you starve to death
- Find food, but check if it's safe first

**Health**
- Damaged in combat, falls, traps
- Untreated wounds can infect (periodic damage)
- Can cauterize wounds or use medical supplies

**Light**
- Darkness hides details and options
- Torch reveals secrets, helps in combat
- Light sources can run out or be lost

**Temperature**
- Start wet and cold
- Hypothermia risk if too cold too long
- Some areas are extremely hot

**Sanity**
- Witnessing horrors reduces sanity
- Low sanity causes hallucinations
- Making dark choices (cannibalism, murder) reduces sanity
- At 0 sanity, you go permanently insane

## Death System

Death is permanent for that playthrough. Common deaths include:

**Environmental:**
- Drowning
- Starvation
- Freezing
- Infection
- Poisoning
- Falling
- Traps

**Combat:**
- Killed by enemies (ghouls, guards, the Harvester)
- Overwhelmed by numbers
- Fighting without proper equipment

**Horror:**
- Driven mad
- Possessed
- Sacrificed
- Harvested for parts
- Cursed to death

**Ridiculous/Unexpected:**
- Eating poisonous food
- Triggering elaborate traps
- Betrayal by allies
- Accidental self-harm
- Random bad luck

## Endings

The game has 100 possible endings:
- 10 "good" endings (true freedom, heroic escape, etc.)
- 90 "bad" endings (wounded escape, became monster, etc.)

Endings depend on:
- How you escaped
- Who you saved/killed
- What you became
- What you learned
- What you lost

## Strategy Tips

1. **Get Light Early**
   - Finding a torch/tinderbox is crucial
   - Light reveals hidden paths and items
   - Critical for combat

2. **Manage Resources**
   - Don't waste food or healing items
   - Save powerful items for bosses
   - Keep hunger below 80

3. **Choose Battles Wisely**
   - Not every fight can be won
   - Sometimes talking or running is better
   - Surprise attacks have advantages

4. **Read Carefully**
   - Descriptions contain hints
   - Warning signs are there for a reason
   - "Seems safe" often isn't

5. **Equipment Matters**
   - A weapon vastly improves survival
   - Armor can save your life
   - Don't be too greedy when looting

6. **Track Your Condition**
   - Monitor health, hunger, sanity
   - Treat wounds before infection
   - Rest when stamina is low (if safe)

7. **Morality Choices**
   - Dark choices (cannibalism, murder) have consequences
   - Helping others may cost you
   - Self-preservation vs. humanity

## Key Locations

**Starting Cell** - Flooded, rapidly filling with water
**Drainage Tunnel** - Escape route from cell
**Main Corridors** - Guarded, dangerous but direct
**Sewers** - Disgusting, rat-infested, but less guarded
**Lower Levels** - Ancient, mysterious, very dangerous
**Trophy Room** - Contains the key, guarded by horrors
**Overseer's Chambers** - Final confrontation area

## Important Characters

**Zagreus (You)** - Betrayed, imprisoned, fighting to survive

**The Overseer** - Mad scientist running the dungeon

**The Harvester** - Monster that collects body parts
- Weakness: Fire
- Very dangerous, avoid if possible

**Elena** - Potential ally, fellow prisoner
- Can help you escape
- Requires protection

**Guards** - Some can be reasoned with, some cannot

**Cultists** - Worship dark powers in the depths

## Special Mechanics

**Custom Actions**
Describe what you want to do, AI evaluates feasibility:
- "Climb the wall using the chain"
- "Pretend to be dead"
- "Mix the herbs to create medicine"
- "Threaten the guard"

**Converging Paths**
Different choices can lead to same location:
- You might have items from one path
- Or lack items from another
- Or have made different enemies/allies

**State Persistence**
Your choices have lasting effects:
- Items persist between nodes
- Wounds don't heal automatically
- Enemies remember you
- Allies can be lost

## Replayability

Each playthrough is different based on:
- Which paths you take
- What items you find
- Who you trust
- What risks you take
- Random chance in some scenarios

The game is designed for multiple playthroughs to:
- Discover all paths
- Find all endings
- Learn enemy patterns
- Optimize survival strategies
- Experience different story branches

## Time Limit

The game is designed to be completable in 15-20 minutes if you:
- Make efficient choices
- Know the optimal path
- Have good luck

First playthroughs typically end in death within 5-10 minutes.

## Difficulty

This game is intentionally:
- **Brutal**: Death is common
- **Unfair**: Some situations have no good choice
- **Dark**: Horror and tragedy are frequent
- **Complex**: Many mechanics to track
- **Unforgiving**: Mistakes are often fatal

Success requires:
- Learning from deaths

**Remember**: You will die. A lot. That's part of the game.
Each death teaches you something about the dungeon.
Can you find a path to freedom? Or will you become another forgotten corpse in the darkness?
