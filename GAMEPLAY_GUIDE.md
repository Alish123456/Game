# Zagreus' Descent - Gameplay Guide

## Overview
This is a complex, narrative-driven dungeon crawler with deep branching paths, enhanced AI-powered responses, status effects, and brutal difficulty.

## Core Mechanics

### Decision System
- Each situation presents 4-6+ choices
- Choices lead to different paths through the story tree (287+ nodes)
- Paths can branch, converge, or dead-end
- Some choices are only available with specific items/conditions
- Your choices have long-term consequences

### Enhanced AI Dungeon Master
When you select "Custom action", you can type anything you want to do.
The AI evaluates your action based on:

1. **Your Stats**
   - Strength: Physical power, melee damage, breaking objects
   - Agility: Dodge chance, hit rate, climbing, stealth
   - Mind: Resist mental effects, solve puzzles, persuasion, perception

2. **Your Equipment**
   - Weapon: Increases damage (+10 base, more for quality), unlocks attack options
   - Light source: Reveals hidden details, improves accuracy (+10-20), critical for darkness
   - Armor: Reduces damage taken, but makes stealth harder and swimming more difficult
   - Offhand: Shield or secondary weapon for blocking/parrying
   - Accessory: Special effects and bonuses

3. **Your Condition**
   - Health: Current/max HP (death at 0)
   - Stamina: Energy for actions (recovers when resting)
   - Hunger: Increases every 5 turns, death at 100
   - Wetness: Affects temperature regulation and stealth
   - Temperature: Hypothermia below 20, death from exposure
   - Sanity: Low sanity causes hallucinations, affects speech
   - Fear: High fear attracts the Harvester faster

4. **Status Effects**
   - Bleeding: Continuous damage over time (-2-3 HP/turn)
   - Poisoned: Damages health and stamina (-5 each/turn)
   - Burning: Intense damage (-8 HP/turn)
   - Infected: Reduces max health over time (-1 max HP/turn)
   - Stunned: Cannot act effectively
   - Slowed: Movement and accuracy penalties
   - Hasted: Bonus to accuracy and actions

5. **Body Status**
   - Can lose limbs (arms, legs)
   - Can lose eyes (impairs vision)
   - Missing body parts severely affect available actions

6. **Equipment Durability**
   - All equipment degrades over time (every 8 turns)
   - Broken equipment becomes useless
   - Plan for equipment failure

### Enhanced Combat System
Combat uses the AI Dungeon Master system with deep tactical options:

**Combat Actions:**
- "Aim for its eyes" - High critical damage if vulnerable, may blind enemy
- "Strike the throat" - Critical location, causes bleeding, high risk/reward
- "Dodge and counter" - Requires agility, avoids damage and counterstrikes
- "Attack its legs" - Can slow enemy, reduce mobility
- "Block with weapon/shield" - Requires equipment, reduces damage
- "Parry and riposte" - High skill check, opens enemy for follow-up
- "Feint and strike" - Uses Mind stat, creates opening
- "Grapple" - Strength check, restrains enemy
- "Use fire" - Effective against certain enemies (ghouls), requires torch

**Combat Factors:**
- Enemy type and specific weaknesses
- Your weapon quality and durability
- Light level (darkness = major penalties)
- Your wounds and missing limbs  
- Status effects on you and enemy
- Environmental hazards
- Equipment bonuses to damage, defense, accuracy
- Critical hit chance (5% base + agility + bonuses)
- Counterattack chance (based on enemy and your defense)

**Status Effects in Combat:**
- Stunned: Skip turn, cannot act
- Bleeding: Take ongoing damage
- Burning: High ongoing damage, spreads
- Blinded: Severe accuracy penalty
- Slowed: Easier to hit, harder to dodge
- Poisoned: Weakens over time

### Survival Elements

**Hunger**
- Increases every 5 turns automatically
- At 100, you starve to death
- Find food, but check if it's safe first
- Some food can poison or infect you

**Health & Wounds**
- Damaged in combat, falls, traps
- Untreated wounds can infect (periodic damage)
- Bleeding wounds need immediate treatment
- Can cauterize wounds or use medical supplies
- Max health can decrease from infection

**Light**
- Darkness hides details, options, and enemies
- Torch reveals secrets, helps in combat (+10-20 accuracy)
- Light sources have durability and can break
- Brightness affects exploration success
- Some creatures fear fire

**Temperature**
- Start wet and cold from flooded cell
- Wetness makes you colder and noisier
- Hypothermia damage below 20 temperature
- Can warm up by moving or finding heat
- Some areas are extremely hot

**Sanity**
- Witnessing horrors reduces sanity
- Low sanity causes hallucinations
- Making dark choices (cannibalism, murder) reduces sanity
- At very low sanity, hallucinations affect perception
- Affects persuasion and puzzle-solving ability

**Fear**
- Grows in dangerous situations
- High fear attracts the Harvester
- Can be reduced by feeling safe or brave actions
- Affects decision-making

**Stamina**
- Used for strenuous actions (climbing, swimming, sprinting)
- Recovers slowly when resting
- Low stamina reduces action effectiveness
- Different actions cost different amounts

## Death System

Death is permanent for that playthrough. Common deaths include:

**Environmental:**
- Drowning in water
- Starvation (hunger = 100)
- Freezing (hypothermia)
- Infection from wounds
- Poisoning from food/traps
- Falling from heights
- Trap activation

**Combat:**
- Killed by enemies (ghouls, guards, the Harvester)
- Overwhelmed by numbers
- Fighting without proper equipment
- Accumulated wounds and bleeding

**Horror:**
- Driven mad (sanity = 0)
- Possessed by dark forces
- Sacrificed to dark powers
- Harvested for body parts
- Cursed to death

**Status Effects:**
- Bleeding out over multiple turns
- Burning to death
- Poisoned to death
- Infected wounds leading to death

## Endings

The game has 100 possible endings:
- 10 "good" endings (true freedom, heroic escape, etc.)
- 90 "bad" endings (wounded escape, became monster, corrupted, etc.)

Endings depend on:
- How you escaped
- Who you saved/killed
- What you became
- What you learned
- What you lost
- Your final sanity and morality

## Strategy Tips

1. **Prioritize Light Sources**
   - Finding a torch/tinderbox is crucial early
   - Light reveals hidden paths and items
   - Critical for combat success
   - Affects exploration rolls significantly

2. **Manage Resources Carefully**
   - Don't waste food, healing items, or water
   - Save powerful items for critical moments
   - Keep hunger below 80
   - Monitor equipment durability

3. **Combat Strategy**
   - Not every fight can be won
   - Sometimes talking or running is smarter
   - Surprise attacks have major advantages
   - Target weak points when possible
   - Use environment and status effects
   - Retreat when badly wounded

4. **Read Carefully**
   - Descriptions contain vital hints
   - Warning signs are there for a reason
   - "Seems safe" often isn't
   - Pay attention to smells, sounds, feelings

5. **Equipment Management**
   - A weapon vastly improves survival
   - Armor saves lives but affects stealth/swimming
   - Light sources are essential
   - Monitor durability—gear can break
   - Don't be too greedy when looting

6. **Track Your Condition**
   - Monitor health, hunger, sanity, temperature
   - Treat wounds before infection sets in
   - Rest when stamina is low (if safe)
   - Keep wetness manageable
   - Watch for status effect buildup

7. **Morality Choices**
   - Dark choices (cannibalism, murder) have consequences
   - Helping others may cost resources
   - Self-preservation vs. humanity
   - Sanity loss from evil acts
   - Some choices change who you become

8. **Status Effects**
   - Treat bleeding immediately
   - Cure poison when possible
   - Extinguish burning quickly
   - Prevent infection from getting worse
   - Some effects are temporary, others permanent

**State Persistence**
Your choices have lasting effects:

- Experience different story branches
- Try different character approaches

## Time Management

The game is designed to be completable in 15-20 minutes if you:
